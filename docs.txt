    
    Smart Multi-Business Booking Marketplace Platform

    
    1. Project Overview

    Project Name (working title): BookMall

    BookMall is a multi-tenant, marketplace-style booking platform that hosts multiple independent businesses (e.g., salons, clinics, service providers) under one unified system — similar to a digital mall. Each business operates its own booking system, staff, services, and rules, while the platform owner manages everything centrally.

    The platform supports different business types, each with configurable booking logic, operating hours, and service definitions. Clients can browse businesses, compare services, and book appointments seamlessly across the platform.

    This project demonstrates SaaS multi-tenancy, marketplace architecture, advanced access control, and scalable system design.

    

    
    
    2. Vision &amp; Business Concept

    
    Core Idea

    One platform

    Many businesses

    Unified booking experience

    Examples of hosted businesses: - Hair &amp; beauty salons - Clinics &amp; medical centers - Training providers - Consultants &amp; freelancers - Repair &amp; maintenance services

    Each business behaves like an independent mini-system inside the larger platform.

    5. Multi-Tenancy Strategy

    
    Chosen Approach: Single Database, Tenant-Aware Design

    Every business has a business_id

    All core tables are scoped by business_id

    Global users table with role mapping per business

    Why this approach: - Easier deployment - Scales well - Common SaaS industry pattern

    

    
    
    
    6. Updated Database Design

    
    businesses

    id

    name

    category

    status (pending, active, suspended)

    timezone

    created_at

    
    
    business_users

    id

    business_id

    user_id

    role (business_admin, staff)

    
    
    services

    id

    business_id

    name

    duration_minutes

    price

    buffer_time

    
    
    staff_availability

    id

    business_id

    staff_id

    day_of_week

    start_time

    end_time

    
    
    bookings

    id

    business_id

    service_id

    staff_id

    client_id

    start_time

    end_time

    status

    

    
    
    
    7. Booking Logic (Marketplace-Aware)

    
    Slot Calculation Flow

    Client selects business

    Selects service

    Load staff linked to service

    Calculate availability using business rules

    Prevent cross-business conflicts

    
    
    Key Constraints

    Bookings never overlap within the same business

    Staff can belong to multiple businesses (optional)

    Timezone respected per business

    

    
    
    
    8. API Design (Examples)

    
    Public

    GET /api/businesses

    GET /api/businesses/{id}/services

    
    
    Booking

    GET /api/businesses/{id}/available-slots

    POST /api/bookings

    
    
    Business Admin

    POST /api/businesses/{id}/services

    GET /api/businesses/{id}/reports

    

    
    
    
    9. Frontend Structure

    
    Public Marketplace

    Homepage (business discovery)

    Category pages

    Business profile pages

    
    
    Business Dashboard

    Services management

    Staff &amp; availability

    Business analytics

    
    
    Client Area

    Unified booking history

    Favorites

    Notifications

    

    
    
    
    10. Monetization (Optional but Impressive)

    Subscription plans per business

    Commission per booking

    Featured business listings

    

    
    
    11. Security &amp; Isolation

    Middleware enforcing business_id

    Policy-based authorization

    Platform-level vs business-level permissions

    

    
    
    12. Scalability &amp; Growth

    Horizontal scaling

    Read replicas

    Cache business metadata

    Background jobs per tenant

    

    
    
    13. Resume-Ready Description

    Designed and developed a multi-tenant booking marketplace platform enabling multiple businesses to manage independent services, staff, and scheduling within a unified SaaS architecture using Laravel REST APIs and React.

    

    
    
    14. Why This Project Stands Out

    Demonstrates SaaS &amp; marketplace thinking

    Shows multi-tenant architecture

    Handles real-world scheduling complexity

    Easily extensible to payments &amp; mobile apps
